# Design choice
- As the design of the example site is a commonly used composition, I tried to imitate it as much as possible because it would be helpful for practice.
- To give a big contrast when hovering on the card, the background is dark navy and shadow effect is added with the complementary color red.
- I also chose blue-colored fixed items at the bottom right.
- While searching for an audio source to integrate into the project, I found that classical music was copyright-free, making it easy to select. This led me to decide the site concept.

# Development process
- I connected a YouTube link to each artists's photos and designated a fluid typography to match the screen ratio for media query use.
- I specified a transition that moves over when the fixed item hovered and linked to Toronto Symphony Orchestra website to purchase tickets.

## Trouble shooting
- When clicking on the top header, an issue occurred while applying the scroll down function to the corresponding part and is in progress. It is assumed that the sticky position part of the header is working.
